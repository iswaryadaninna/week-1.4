Traffic Light Simulator
Description:
The Traffic Light Simulator is a simple, interactive web application that mimics the behavior of a real-world traffic light system. It simulates the cycling of three traffic light states: red, yellow, and green. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and offers users the ability to manually control the traffic light cycle or automatically start the light-changing process at a timed interval.

Key Features:
Manual Control: Users can manually cycle through the red, yellow, and green lights using the "Change Light" button.
Automatic Cycle: The lights can be set to change automatically every 2 seconds, simulating a real-time traffic signal cycle with the "Start Automatic Cycle" button.
Smooth Transitions: The light transitions smoothly between the different colors, giving the experience a more realistic feel.
Responsive Design: The layout is designed to be simple and responsive, ensuring that the application looks great across different screen sizes, from desktop to mobile devices.
Visual Design:
The traffic light system is represented using a set of circular elements that are color-coded to resemble actual traffic lights:

Red Light: Stops vehicles and pedestrians.
Yellow Light: Alerts to prepare to stop or go, depending on the scenario.
Green Light: Signals vehicles to go.
The application interface is minimalistic, with an elegant, modern design:

The background has a soft, neutral color to maintain focus on the traffic light system.
Buttons have an appealing, interactive appearance with smooth hover and active states, ensuring an engaging user experience.
Technologies Used:
HTML: Structure of the traffic light elements and buttons.
CSS: Styling of the page, including light colors, buttons, transitions, and responsiveness.
JavaScript: Functionality for light transitions, manual light changes, and automatic cycles.
How to Use:
Open the application in a modern browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
You will see a traffic light simulator with three circular lights: red, yellow, and green.
Click the "Change Light" button to manually cycle through the lights.
Click the "Start Automatic Cycle" button to start the light-changing cycle automatically.
The lights will change every 2 seconds during the automatic cycle, and the user can manually switch them anytime by clicking the "Change Light" button.
Example Use Case:
This project can serve as a fun way to simulate the behavior of traffic lights for educational purposes or as a beginner-friendly JavaScript project to understand DOM manipulation, CSS transitions, and event handling.
